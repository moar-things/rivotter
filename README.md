rivotter - visualizes moar profiles
================================================================================

The [`moar-profiler`][moar-profiler] tool can be used to generate v8 cpu
profiles for Node.js applications, and adds even moar data to the cpu profile
than v8 generates.

The `rivotter` can be used to view those profiles.

Currently the view is implemented as a static web application, which can be
deployed anywhere a static web site can be deployed.  It's currently deployed
publicly at https://moar-things.github.io/rivotter/

Help is available within the application.
