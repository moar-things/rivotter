    <p>
      The rivotter, available at
      <a href="https://moar-things.github.io/rivotter">
        https://moar-things.github.io/rivotter
      </a>,
      can be used to view v8 CPU profiles generated for Node.js
      applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more information and background on v8 CPU profiles, see the article
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/rendering-tools/js-execution">

    <h2>generating a cpu profile file</h2>

    <p>
      The following tools can be used to generate a v8 CPU profile for
      Node.js:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/moar-things/moar-profiler">
          moar-profiler
        </a>
      </li>

          NodeSource's N|Solid product
        </a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/v8-profiler">
          v8-profiler package at npm
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Most tools generate CPU profile files with a file extension of
      <tt>.cpuprofile</tt> .  Once you have a CPU profile file, you
      can view it by visiting
      <a href="https://moar-things.github.io/rivotter">
        https://moar-things.github.io/rivotter
      </a> . You can either drag the file onto the web page, or load
      it from an input button on the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a few <tt>.cpuprofile</tt> files available
      in the
      <a href="https://github.com/moar-things/rivotter/tree/master/test/fixtures">
        rivotter repository in the <tt>test/fixtures</tt> directory
      </a>.
      You probably want to try the "real life" on of a run of
      <tt>npm update</tt>, which you can download via this link:
      <a download="npm-update.moar.cpuprofile" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moar-things/rivotter/master/test/fixtures/npm-update.moar.cpuprofile">
        <tt>npm-update.moar.cpuprofile</tt>
      </a>.
    </p>

    <h2>anatomy of rivotter</h2>

    <p>Below is the web page with a profile loaded.</p>

    <p><img src="images/screen-cap-annotated.png" width="100%"></p>

    <p>The page is split into three panes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        the top pane displays a table of functions used by
        your application, sorted by time used
      </li>
      <li>
        the pane on the bottom left displays information about
        the currently selected function, including what functions
        call the currently selected function, and what functions are
        called by the currently selected function
      </li>
      <li>
        the pane on the bottom right displays source for the
        currently selected function, when available
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When you click on a function in any of the three panes, the
      top pane will scroll to that function, and highlight it in
      purple to indicate that it's the currently selected function.
      Other functions in the top pane will be colored green or yellow
      if the selected function is called by the function (green) or
      calls the function (yellow).
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottom panes will be updated to show relevant information
      for the selected function.  Functions which are called by, or
      that call the selected function, will be shown in the top pane
      with a yellow highlight.
    </p>

    <p>
      The source code in the bottom right pane is annotated with blue and
      red lines and bubbles.  The blue lines and bubbles indicate
      functions which are listed in the top pane.  The red lines and bubbles
      are lines within a function which the profile recorded statistics for.
    </p>

    <p>
      To load a CPU profile from within this page, click the file
      upload button shown at <span class="red-box">A</span>, which
      will prompt you for a file to load.  Or you can drag and drop
      a file onto the web page.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can "zoom" into a pane (hiding the other panes) by clicking
      the "zoom buttons" shown at <span class="red-box">B</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Information about your Node.js process is shown on the line
      at <span class="red-box">C</span>.  This information is only
      available with profiles generated with moar-profiler.
    </p>

    <p>
      Functions in the top pane can be sorted by total time or self
      time, by clicking the respective buttons at
      <span class="red-box">D</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, only functions shown in "user" code is displayed.
      "User" code is code not shipped with the Node.js runtime; eg,
      the built-in modules fs, path, etc, are not "user" code.  You
      can change to show all code, or back to just "user" code,
      by clicking the respective buttons at
      <span class="red-box">E</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "link" image beside package names, shown at
      <span class="red-box">F</span>, will open that package's page
      at npmjs.org, when clicked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where functions are shown in the bottom panes, they can be
      clicked to change the page to show information about that
      function.  Examples are shown at <span class="red-box">G</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>frequently asked questions</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><b>What are the red bubbles in the source code?</b>
      <p>
        The V8 CPU Profiler occaisonally provides information about
        particular lines within a function; those lines are annotated
        with a red bubble.  Note that the V8 CPU Profiler typically doesn't
        provide many of these.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><b>The yellow and green lines in function list in the top pane don't seem right.</b>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that a function can both call a function and be called by
        the same function.  Those functions are marked green (calls selected
        function).
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><b>There seem to be functions missing in the function list.</b>
      <p>V8 does a great job inlining functions, as an optimization.
        That is, it moves the body of a function into the caller of the
        function.  When this happens, the function that gets reported will
        be the caller, not the actual function.  Consider using the option
        <tt>--no-use_inlining</tt> when running your node application to turn
        off inlining, to get the correct accounting.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Something still seems wrong.</b>

        Expect that you may need to provide your `.cpuprofile` file, to
        reproduce the issue.
